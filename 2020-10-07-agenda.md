- Reversed schema hierarchy (see details in last call agenda,
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/devcalls/blob/master/2020-09-30-agenda.md#schema-genesis-versioning>)
- Public state extensions: decentralized issuance & "call to contract method"

  * implementation for RGB data: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/blob/master/src/rgb/bech32.rs>

## Finalization of the decisions

- LN asset naming & divisions 
  * naming: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/60>
  * divisibility: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/51>
  NB: what about NFT sub-divisibility for LN?
- LNPBP-1 & 2 refactoring: keyset commitments:
  * [x] proposal: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/48>
  * [x] other changes to LNPBP1: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/66>
  * [x] LNPBP1 changes: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/pull/67>
  * [ ] LNPBP2 update is WIP
  * [x] implementation: <https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/125>
- PSBT custom keys: one removed (fee), the second one, keeping tweaking factor is 
  replaced with non-proprietary; which is planned to be added to BIP-174 standard
- Universal protocol for node oprations (RGB, LNP, Bifrost ...): node ids, 
  compatible messaging system & message ids (see details in last call agenda)
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/55>
- UDP hole punchng discussion results <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/39>

## Protocol future

- NFT transfers in generalized LN with channel factories
- Sign to contract instead of pay to contract commitments
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/65>
- MW-like Pedensen commitment aggregation for the historical data
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/57>
- Merge-mined chain allowing excellend scalability with single-key-per-block concept
