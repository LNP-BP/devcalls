## RGB Protocol

### Invoicing

- New unified invoicing proposal with protocol layerization, extensibility,
  interoperability:
  * "Payment specification" layer. Current example - Bitcoin addresses.
    Will be extended for RGB with new types from 
    [this table](https://github.com/LNP-BP/devcalls/issues/25#issuecomment-689858806):
    - Blinded UTXO (RGB-specific)
    - Descriptor-based (can be used for Bitcoin also). Hints:
      * Deterministic key derivation with block height
      * In RGB we can make keys truly random since we know payment txo anyway from
        the consignment
    - PSBT-based (can be used for Bitcoin!)
    - Channel (LN)-based: not the same as BOLT-11, but just a node id, address
      and routing hints
  * "Invoce" layer (current example - BOLT-11, parts of the proposed 
    [BOLT-12/13](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/798))
    - Just an LN message serialized into Bech32 format!
    - Now LN messages can be send over non-interactive or high-latency networks
      (mesh, satellite, SMTP/mail, messengers/tweets)
    - Very extensible: TLVs, new message types. Making new invoice type is just like
      defining new LN message: decentralized
  * "Interactive payment protocol" layer (current examples - BIP70, LNURL, 
     BOLT12 from above)
    - Potentially should work with any invoice and data type (it is the case for
      LNURL already; will try to direct BOLT12 into this; BIP70 is depricated anyway)
    - We will have Bifrost for RGB-related interactivity; it will utilize LN
      messaging format so complete invoice data workflow (offer/request/invoice/
      failback/alternative) may fit into bech32-encoded strings as described below:
- Bech32 encodings for invoicing & RGB-related data entities
  * Any message can be serialized with `<4hex>_lnp1bechdata`, or for known formats
    `<id>[_<4hex>_lnp]1bechdata` (this is interoperable with Russel new invoices),
    for instance `inv1invoicedata` can be a universal invoice message.
  * Bech32 for raw data (non-LN messages) will use normal HRPs, so this
    is backward-compatible with current Bech32 use, and will fit well with RGB-
    related Bech32 for hashes (RGB contract id, schema id etc) and data types.
    See sample implementation in 
    <https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/112/commits/485ea355e625624aba40679f134be94cd47882d5>
  * Public keys & LN node ids can also use Bech32 encoding with `pk_` prefixes:
    - `pk1keydata` - for public keys
    - `pkx1keydata` - for extended public keys
    - `pkn1keydata` - for node ids in LN (b/c of the unification, see below, this id
      will work with LN, RGB network & Bifrost)
    This can potentially replace multiple formats (WIFs, hex encoded keys, BASE64 
    encoded xpubs and serve the original goals for which Bech32 encoding was proposed.

### Schema, genesis, versioning

- Schema extensibility for things like 
  [multiple asset schemas](https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/44):
  instead of extending schema, we will have one "most advanced" schema
  with all features (for assets, NFTs, reputation etc) and smaller sub-schemas
  which will commit to the most advanced schema for which they are just
  a subset. It will resolve security considerations by Alekos Filini and
  allow simple wallet adoption of new asset schema types.
- Interoperability & networks explanations and structuring:
  * P2P network differentiation (`P2pNetworkIds` and `NetworkMagic`)
  * Layer 1 differentiation: `ChainHash` and `ChainParams`
  * Xpub/Xpriv specifics: `ChainCode`
  * Asset cross-layer differentiation (on-chain `ChainHash`, CA, RGB, OMNI): 
    `AssetId`
  * Bringing it all together with single & simple `Chain`
- How it is used:
  * Schema do not commit to anything
  * Genesis commits to chain hash, but stores full set of chain params
  * This is why genesis needs a "data structure version" flag in chainparams
    field (to allow chain params extensibility), and must represent a list
    of data, starting from the first version
  * LN nodes uses `AssetId` as a `ChainHash` to identify in which "network" 
    they operate/accept channels
- More LN-specific asset details for asset geneses: 
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/60>
- RGB versioning clarification:
  * Schema has a version identifying RGB protocol version
    <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/45>. An RGB contract genesis
    (asset issuance) commits to Schema and thus to a specific RGB protocol
    version forever: no "forks"/version upgrades within single contracts,
    but different contracts from different issuers may operate on different
    RGB versions
  * Consignments use "serializetion version" field indicating network 
    serialization format used for data transfer. Receiver specifies desired/
    supported formats as a part of invoice data. This allows more efficient
    compression of network-transferred data (like use of bulletproof/pedersen
    aggregation, shor bitcoin ids)
  * Genesis uses version for ChainParams field data structure (see above),
    which has nothing to do with protocol or serialization version. Receiver
    do not need to specify version in invoice, since all legacy versions are
    always included.

### Protocol unification

- Proposed invoicing protocol operate not only with RGB, but also can be
  used for native bitcoin on-chain and LN payments.
- API/message type unification for RGB Node, Ligthning network (all nodes)
  and future Bifrost. Now node type will be defined just by the set of
  features, and networks can inter-operate.
- RGB Node, LNP Node and Bifrost will be unifiable into a single piece of
  software, so wallet devs will be able to use just a single integration
  point to run RGB onchain, RGB lightning & native lightning payments.

- [amplify](https://docs.rs/amplify/1.0.0/amplify/) & 
  [amplify_derive](https://docs.rs/amplify_derive/1.0.0/amplify_derive/) 
  crates v1.0 release with extensive test coverage using GitHub actions.

### Completed implementation

- Better bulletproof commitments 
  [implemented & merged](https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/pull/107)

### WIP

- Key management  & signing functionality within LNP Node will help wallet devs
  with this part of functionality. Unfortunatelly we can't use BDK since it lacks 
  RGB specific PSBT key type support (for Pk tweaks) and Xpub/Xpriv other chains, 
  so LNP/BP Core library will include special mod for all necessary extensions to
  Xpub/Xpriv keys and PSBTs, as well as signers, based on miniscript, supporting 
  necessary RGB functionality. See sections above on more details to Xpub/Xpriv 
  specifics.
- Better test coverage approaching ~60% for the Core Library and ~100% for the 
  underlying amplify crate, including new exhaustive tests for some encodings
  covering all possible encoding options.
- Better code docs: ~50% for the Core Library & 100% for the underlying amplify
  crate.
