- Docker images for RGB Node v0.1 
  <https://hub.docker.com/layers/lnpbp/rgbd/v0.1.0/images/sha256-e0d6f7b0e7b8da32c77026d43df2674df6d9069bf93f415b91e8f15a62947100?context=explore>
  and overall docker v1.1 repo release 
  https://github.com/LNP-BP/docker/releases/tag/v1.1.0

**Features:**
- Supporting Rust stable and down to v1.41! Removed all unstable language components
- No more upstream forks, for now dependencies are only on published bitcoin-related 
  crates (miniscript v2, bitcoin v0.25, latest bitcoin_hashes with Taproot updates, 
  removed unstable lightning dependency)
- SQLite support for RGB Node by @rajarshimaitra

RGB SDK <https://github.com/LNP-BP/rgb-sdk> is prepared for the release this week 
by @zoedberg

## Lightning Network

- Generalized payment channels and relation to RGB and LN Node
- LNP Node architecture and overall design approach to node architecture

- Universal protocol for node oprations (RGB, LNP, Bifrost ...): node ids, 
  compatible messaging system & message ids (see details in last call agenda)
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/55>.
  Explanation on RGB peer network and Bitfrost peer network as a part of 
  Lightning peer network. Considerations and discussions.
- Generalized Lightning networking on top of alternative transports (Websocket, 
  HTTP overlay, SMTP, messaging) and RPC stack with ZMQ et al
- Ongoing work on structuring Internet2 stack as a set of Lightning related networking 
  protocols on top of Tor

## Wallet integration

- Explanations on matters related to DBC tweaks of public keys: lessons learned 
  from Liquid <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/69>
  Excerpt:
  *After discussion with Andrew Poelstra it became obvious that the previous decision of storing public key tweak information within PSBT as a single value (https://github.com/LNP-BP/rust-lnpbp/issues/86) will be insecure and incompatible with hardware signing units, wallets or airgapped solutions. The problems is that the device must be able to verify what is hidden behind the tweak, otherwise it will be possible for a malware to change the tweak in such a way that it will substitue the underlying state transition with some other (assigning assets to the thief-controlled UTXOs) or, even, apply some taproot-based alternative spending conditions.*
- PSBT-based workflows <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/71>
- Simple APIs for read-only access <https://github.com/LNP-BP/rgb-node/issues/84>

## Protocol future

- NFT transfers in generalized LN with channel factories
- UDP hole punchng discussion results <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/39>
  and overall UDP support + Dazaar/Hypercore integration
- Sign to contract instead of pay to contract commitments
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/65>
- MW-like Pedensen commitment aggregation for the historical data
  <https://github.com/LNP-BP/LNPBPs/issues/57>
- Merge-mined chain allowing excellend scalability with single-key-per-block concept
